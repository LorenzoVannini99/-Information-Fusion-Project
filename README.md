## Overview
This project studies the **map fusion problem** in a multi-robot system.  
Each robot builds a local occupancy grid map using its onboard sensors. These local maps can then be fused into a consistent global map.  

The project investigates both theoretical and experimental aspects:
- Mathematical framework based on the **Kullback-Leibler Average (KLA)** for information fusion  
- Initial simulation experiments  
- More realistic tests with noisy sensors  
- Algorithms based on **travelled distance** and **local efficiency**  

## Features
- Occupancy grid representation  
- Probabilistic map fusion using KLA  
- Noise models for realistic sensing conditions  
- Efficiency metrics related to robot trajectories  
- Example experiments and resulting fused maps  


# Autonomous Agent â€“ Information Fusion for Multi-Robot Mapping

## Mathematical Framework

### Occupancy Grid
We model the environment as an **occupancy grid**, where each cell is a binary random variable:

$ \theta_k \in \{0,1\}, \quad k = 1, \dots, M $

Each robot \( i \) assigns a probability of occupancy to the cell:

\[
P_i(\theta_k) \in [0,1], \quad i = 1,\dots,N
\]

A threshold \(\varepsilon \in [0,0.5]\) allows classification:
- **Free** if \( P_i(\theta_k) < \varepsilon \)  
- **Occupied** if \( P_i(\theta_k) > 1-\varepsilon \)  
- **Uncertain** otherwise  

If no prior knowledge is available:

\[
P_0(\theta_k) = \tfrac{1}{2}
\]
